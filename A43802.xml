            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE <hi>Reverend Dr.</hi> Wake, Chaplain in Ordinary To His Majeſty.</head>
            <p>THE Irreligious World is not ſo dull, as to need information what ways are moſt effectual to the ſuppreſſion of Chriſtianity. A popular contempt of the Myſteries, and a radical averſion to the Authority of the Church does the buſineſs ſmoothly, and without hazard. By Ambition and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, by Fanaticiſm and Sedition, the latter is wholly extinct; and on the ſenſe hereof Infidelity and Hereſie have made their inſolent advances againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. In condolence whereat, the Letter to a Convocation-Man ſeems to have been offered to the World for the uſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:58609:3"/>of the Convocations, againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Impieties in Religion, and rigorous Opinions in matter of Law. 'Twas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hereupon to expect the inſurrection of the Inſidels and Hereticks againſt the Propoſals and Power of a Convocation, to prevent their Cenſure, as well as an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws and Judgments herein from the hands of Lawyers. But who would have dreamed that any Clergy-Man of Dignity and Value in the Church ſhould lift up his heel againſt her? The wounds of Adverſaries, how ſharp ſoever, are never mortal to the Church, The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lawyers is ambulatory, according to the prevalency of Times and Powers, they being only Interpreters of what the Kingdom admits or conſtitutes for Right and Law. And therefore when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the Nation ſubmitted to the Pope, the Courts acknowledged and acted upon his Right or Claim of Supremacy; and when the Nation could ſhake it o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and the King graſp it, then paſt the Judgments and Rules of Court according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Nor can they be blamed herein, for ſo their Office determines them. But when the great Laminaries of the Church ſhall ſign the <hi>Theta</hi> upon her Rights, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Authorities, Divine, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
<pb facs="tcp:58609:3"/>and this voluntarily, and without any Bribe offered, or Menace denounced, the Conceſſion is taken for ſincere, and for that cauſe juſt; ſo that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſuffers more by your Book here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, than by all other Lay or Law Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever. And tis not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but that it may animate the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Powers, not only to lay greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions on the Church, but even to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh all the remainder of her legal Rights and Powers, and put us out of all our Intereſt in the great Charter of the Land. For the Lay Powers, how ſtrongly ſoever they deſire to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over all intereſts, yet generally have ſuch a modeſty towards what is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Sacred, as to attempt nothing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>oriouſly violent without the conceſſion of the Church, or her moſt Eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. So K. H. <hi>VIII</hi> of Famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, notwithſtanding all his Claims at common Law, and his intereſt in his Parliament, thro' Power, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Abbey and Church-Lands, could not have made himſelf ſo abſolute in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticals, had he not procured before the ſubmiſſion of the Clergy; nor could he have compaſſed that, but thro' the terror of a Premunire, under which they
<pb facs="tcp:58609:4"/>had fallen, and upon which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow his blow, and ſo to bend or break them. And yet this Act of a Popiſh, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreformed, and well nigh Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed Convocation extorted for fear of ruine, and thro' ignorance, and non-ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of the Acts conſequent upon it, prejudges more againſt our Liberties than all Secular conſtitutions could peſſibly have done without it. And muſt we now conſecrate all thoſe procedures, the reſults of which we ſeel in the total ruine of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and Chriſtian Piety, by our voluntary Pleas and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations; and to gratiſie the Civil Powers to an Arbitrary utmoſt, violate the moſt important Truths of Principles and Hiſtories, treat the Synods of the Church with ſpite and contumely, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the greateſt ſlavery of her to the appetite of Civil Powers? How much more Honourable had it been, under a Prince, whoſe peculiar Province has ever been at the perpetual hazard of his Life to relieve the Oppreſſed, to have preſented him with ſuch Draughts and Schemes of the Divine Rights, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Authorities, and Diſcipline of the Church, as might inflame him to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for her reſcue; and to add this

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> at the top of all his Glories, as an Euchariſtical Duty and Oblation so God, for all his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providences in his Preſervation and Atchievements.</p>
            <p>For which cauſe you have made it abſolutely neceſſary that your Book ſhould be diſcuſſed, and its dangerous Errors laid open, to the end that the Publick may be under no temptation from ſuch a work, (inſcribed to the Metropolitan) to proceed to further Reſolves againſt the Powers Hierarchical, but may take occaſion to review thoſe Laws, thro' which the Church is fallen under her preſent Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; except you, and wiſer Heads can ſhew, which way a Spiritual Diſcipline may be otherwiſe reſtored to a freedom of doing her Duty toward God, in the cleanſing the Church, and the renovation of Mens Hearts unto Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I have therefore deſigned an Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof in three Parts. The firſt concerning the Divine Powers of the Churches of Chriſt. The ſecond concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matters of Fact in Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. The third concerning the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences for a preſent Convocation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58609:5"/>
            <p> In the mean time I wiſh you no more hurt, than a perpetual increaſe of Merit, Honour, and Promotion here; and that which is the only valuable Proſpect, a Bleſſed Inheritance in the Life to come.</p>

                  <p n="4">§ 4. Being thus harneſſed, we will conſider the ſtrength of the Doctor's <hi>Hyyotheſis</hi> firſt, before we come to juſtiſie that of the Letter.<note place="margin">The Doctor's Principle worſe than the Independents.</note> Firſt then he makes a <hi>Synod</hi> under Heathen Powers to be but an <hi>independent</hi> huddle of Chriſtians in common, contriving their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by no <hi>Authority,</hi> but that of Humane Prudence. But then I ſhall ſay, that if this be a <hi>Synod,</hi> ſuch a Concourſe of mere Lay-Chriſtians may be a <hi>Synod,</hi> and determine the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58609:9"/>common Proceſs of their Conduct. For he places this Care ſimply in the Natural Reaſon of the <hi>Members</hi> of every Church, not the <hi>Governors</hi> nor <hi>Powers</hi> therein conſtituted; for he does not ſuppoſe it a <hi>regular Society,</hi> till incorporated with the <hi>Civil State.</hi> Nor will it help to ſay, that he defines a Synod <hi>a Meeting of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons upon an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Affair,</hi> for all Members of the Church may with Grammatical Propriety be called and accounted <hi>Eccle jaſtica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And, if we will but add one <hi>Paſtor</hi> among them, here we have the true form of an <hi>Independent Church,</hi> or <hi>Congregation,</hi> which is its own conſtant <hi>Synod</hi> at all Meetings; only the <hi>Independent Principle</hi> claims a Divine Right, and relies not alone upon mere humane Inauthoritative Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſo is nearer to Truth and Reaſon, than the Doctor's. But if the Doctor's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be true, that ſuch <hi>Synods</hi> are Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Church-Members</hi> upon Prudence only, without any inherent <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> wherein they are to give the Inſidel Powers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58609:9"/>the leaſt Offence that may be, I doubt that Prudence will oblige them not to convene at all. For certainly we are not in Prudence to give Inſidel Powers, or any Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any needleſs Offence at all. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Subjects having no <hi>Authority</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, yet convening againſt the Laws of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Powers, do incur their great Offence, which natural Reaſon cannot prompt Men to. For if <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be called by ſuch <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Powers</hi> to account for ſuch prohibited Conventions, by what <hi>Authority</hi> they do ſuch things, if they ſhould ſet forth a good <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> this would be a good, though not perhaps a ſucceſsul Plea, but if they ſhould ſay, we have no <hi>Authority</hi> for it, but only <hi>natural Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> how can that direct a Man to diſobey Laws, which deſtroy no Man's <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Right?</hi> Nor can it be ſhifted here, that they have <hi>Right,</hi> but not <hi>Authority;</hi> for, tho even a mere <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>ſynodize,</hi> is enough to the <hi>jus divinum</hi> aſſerted by the Letter, yet a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>ſynodize</hi> is a <hi>Right</hi> to a publick Conduct by Rules and Methods to preſerve the Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, and that is <hi>Authority,</hi> tho never ſo democratical. And if they have <hi>natural Reaſon</hi> for this Conduct, that <hi>Nature</hi> that has given them <hi>juſt Reaſon</hi> has given them <hi>juſt Right</hi> to it; for in ſuch Matters <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> is the ſame, <hi>doing Men Right,</hi> being properly called <hi>doing Men Reaſon.</hi> If then they have <hi>natural Reaſon,</hi> they have <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right,</hi> and if <hi>natural Right, natural Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58609:10"/>to convene for their publick Conduct; and that is a good Plea againſt the Laws of Infidel Powers. But on the contrary, if they have <hi>no Authority</hi> ſo to do, they have <hi>no Right,</hi> and if <hi>no Right, no Reaſon,</hi> and if <hi>no Reaſon,</hi> how can this be done without Offence againſt the Civil Powers that forbid it, and have <hi>juſt Right</hi> indeed to forbid all Aſſemblies, which have no <hi>Authority, Right,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon.</hi> But to conclude, the Dr. has given theſe <hi>Synods</hi> a more fundamental <hi>Authority</hi> than he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, when he tells us, <q>that <hi>the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church when it began to be enlarged,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth did.</note> 
                        <hi>brought them into the Church as the neceſſities of the Councils of State.</hi>
                     </q> Very well; and a good Parallel: but are not <hi>Councils of State</hi> endued with <hi>Authority</hi> founded on that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Neceſſity? The Doctor dares not ſay No to the State, becauſe the <hi>Leviathan</hi> is not ſafely to be angred; but why then ſhould not the <hi>Councils of the Church</hi> be authoritative for its Conduct and Preſervation upon the ſame bottom of equal Neceſſity, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Heathen Powers? For it appears, that on this Neceſſity <hi>Synods</hi> were held in the Church in full Vigour and Spiritual <hi>Authority,</hi> before there were any Chriſtian States for heir Incorporation. And therefore the <hi>neceſſity</hi> was the greater, and by theſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Rules the <hi>Authority</hi> ſhould be ſo too, tho yet he allows them <hi>no Authority,</hi> becauſe <hi>no Society</hi> till their Civil Incorporation, which is (tho the Doctor ſees not the neceſſary Conſequence) to deny the Unity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, and its Conſtitution under
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58609:10"/>Spiritual Governors of its own, for the three firſt Centuries of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. But he further tells us,<note place="margin">Incorp.</note> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation of the Church into the State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Aſſociation for the ſaving of their Souls, as well as Secularities, ſubjects them as much to the Laws and Regulations of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Societies, as any other Public Aſſemblies. This is a bold ſtroke indeed; for it will put the Conſtitution of the Hierarchy, and all its Functions, into what Hands, under what Conduct, Times, and Places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Civil Powers pleaſe. They ſhall enable a Layman to ordain, and Miniſter Sacraments, to Preach, Excommunicate, Abſolve, Conſecrate, and degrade, and do all things by an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Legiſlation and Government thereupon; and well then may this Incorporation into Society promote the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>. But I pray what is this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation? Is it making the Church one of the National Eſtates to concurr in the Acts of Legiſlature? and all her Ratified Canons not only Canon, but Law too, and of Civil Conſequences upon the Subject? Or is it only the Protection of the Law from Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Oppreſſions? or the addition of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Priviledges, Honours, and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? If the firſt of theſe only, then was the Church never incorporated into the State under the Roman Empire; (for it was no part of the Legiſlature) and conſequently not thereupon ſubject to the Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58609:11"/>in Matters of Eccleſiaſtical Conduct. If the ſecond Favour be an Incorporation, then the incorporating Powers have a <hi>Right</hi> to govern the Religion of all other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they tolerate, all Schiſms and Hereſies whatſoever, exempt by Law from Violences and Oppreſſions; ſo that an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtian Emperor tolerating, <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Meletians, Arians, Macedonians, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Eutychians,</hi> and all other Clans of Hereſies, had full <hi>Right,</hi> and good <hi>Authority</hi> to govern all their ſeveral reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and Diſcipline, and to ratiſie all their <hi>Synodical</hi> Acts, Canons, and Sentences. <hi>O Sanctas Gentes!</hi> What a mighty Supremacy would this be indeed, wherein every Prince ſo indulgent would be another <hi>Solomon,</hi> and reſide not only over God's Church at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> but over thoſe of <hi>Chomeſh, Milchom, Aſhtoreth, &amp;c.</hi> a Supremacy I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs more than divine! And yet I doubt it would not be caſily admitted either in <hi>Holland,</hi> or the emulous <hi>England;</hi> where, tho the publick Indulgence is to ſave their Souls, as well as their Temporals, yet will not the Sectaries part with their Souls to theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Saviours, nor endure the Thoughts of their Preſidency and Conduct in their little Religious Politics, but demand an Exemption as entire as the Chappels of foreign Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Embaſſadors. Nor can in the third place an Accumulation of all Encouragements, Priviledges and Honours, prevail upon them hereunto; moſt of them being againſt a National Church, all of them againſt a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

Now tho' I know this to be no Rule of Common or Statute-Law here in ſuch Caſes, yet will the Dr. allow a <hi>Natural Right</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> for ſuch Liberty, even in oppoſition to our Laws, when our King ſhall be of another perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? ſhall the Church lean upon her own <hi>Authority</hi> and Wiſdom, not His?

And can it be then imaginable, that it hath a greater right of Dominion over the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Society</hi> with God, which being the Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Unitive in this Life between God and us, and ſo a <hi>medium</hi> to an Everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in another, was the great End on this ſide Heaven, for which we were firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and for which the other <hi>Societies</hi> next conſequent upon it were deſigned? <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Society</hi> being for the propagation of

And this general Conſideration, that all theſe <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Society</hi> are God's Ordinances, and of theſe, the <hi>Religious Society</hi> with God the firſt in Nature, Diguity, and Time, it cannot be imagined, that God ſhould be divided againſt himſelf, in ſetting up Ordinance againſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and the meaner and the latter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt and higheſt,<note place="margin">Gods Ordiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of, each other.</note> eſpeciully ſince the Nature of the <hi>Society</hi> by God ordained, imports a perpetual neceſſity, and therefore a deſign of perpetnity in them all. And hereupon it is, that Religion in general, though corrupted and diſguiſed, has yet continued among all Nations, as perpetual and univerſal, as the <hi>other Societies,</hi> and carried the moſt publick preeminence, as being the preſumed means of a <hi>Divine Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;</hi> and this, not by the bare policy of Secular Powers; (ſince perhaps in Princes Courts it has ever had the leaſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and true Religion is what the Luſt of Men (eſpecially great Men) are moſt averſe to, and falſe Religion too groſs to impoſe a credulity upon their acute apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) but (an internal diſpoſition of the Mind, univerſally promoting Men to the culture of Religion, againſt all the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and averſions of <hi>Seſuality,</hi> is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

AFter the Knowledge of all this, which I am ſure the Dr. well knew, before ever he dreamed of Writing upon this Subject, 'tis a matter of aſtoniſhment to me, that he ſhould look upon Synods under Alien Powers, to have been, and ſtill to be, but prudential Clubs, without any <hi>Authority</hi> from God, or Man. And yet upon this confidence 'tis ſtrange, that he ſhould not wholly deliver them up to the full Authority of all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or Alien Powers, againſt which, where there is no right, no Human Reaſon, or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can warrant any popular Frequences or Councils.

                  </gap>ting them <hi>Right</hi> to grant them <hi>Authority</hi> to hold Synods under Alien Powers. And yet he is unwilling, even to allow what he grants, and floats up and down in his Doubts hereupon, and caſts an unlucky glance upon the Primitive <hi>Synods,</hi> as ſcarce capable of <hi>Excuſe,</hi> and more hardly of <hi>Juſtiſication.</hi> 
                  <q>It has been (ſaith he) ever look'd upon as one great part of the Princes Prerogative,<note place="margin">p. 13.</note> that no Societies ſhould be Incorporated, nor any Companies be allowed to meet
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58609:45"/>together, without his Knowledge and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The <hi>Roman Law</hi> was eſpecially very ſevere as to this Matter. And tho' after the Converſion of the Emperors to the Faith of Chriſt, a Proviſion was made for the <hi>Publick</hi> Aſſemblies of the Church for Divine Service; yet <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who underſtood theſe Matters as well as any one of his Time, tho' he excuſed their Meetings upon all other Accounts, could not deny, but that they fell under the <hi>Cenſure</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> and that having not the <hi>Princes Leave</hi> to meet together, they were in the <hi>Conſtruction of the Law,</hi> guilty of Meeting againſt it.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. This brings one therefore to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,<note place="margin">Conventions Neceſſary, Innocent, Hurtful.</note> What Meetings are of right obnoxious to the prohibitions and penalties of Humane Laws. The Conventions therefore of Men are of three ſorts; either <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> or <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> or <hi>Hurtful.</hi> And firſt, ſuch as are <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> no Man whatſoever can have a <hi>rightful Authority</hi> to reſtrain; for <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> being a <hi>Law</hi> from God, cannot be vacated by any poſitive Law of Man. Nor, Secondly, can <hi>Innocent Meetings</hi> be rightfully denyed in themſelves, but under the apprehenſions of hurt or danger upon Time, Place and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. But <hi>Hurtful Meetings,</hi> in the Third <hi>Place,</hi> may not only, but ought of Right to be reſtrained by the Magiſtracy. Yet what Princes have no <hi>Rightful Authority</hi> to do, that they may <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> do upon an <hi>uncountroulable Domination</hi> and <hi>Impunity.</hi> Upon which, when they preſume to Repreſs our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58609:45"/>Rights and Liberties, if it be in Matters <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> they are to be diſobeyed in Fact, and ſubmitted to as to their Legal Proceſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance; if in Matters barely <hi>Innocent,</hi> there Prudence will direct, but no bare Conſcience of Duty to the Tyrannical Law alone, will oblige to obſervation, tho' it will to Patience, under Legal Sufferings. For an Innocent Liberty is an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nalienable Franchiſe</hi> of our Nature, and all prohibitions of it, as ſuch ſimply, are meer Nullities, as to the Rule of practical Conſcience. And if ſo, how extreamly wide of Truth is it, at large, to ſay, <q>That it has ever been looked upon as one principal part of the Princes Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, that no Companies be allowed to meet together without his knowledge and permiſſion?</q> Where I muſt take <hi>Permiſſion</hi> to be <hi>Voluntary,</hi> and ſuch as the Prince may rightly deny, or elſe 'tis nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For if a Prince only <hi>permit,</hi> becauſe he has no right to <hi>deny</hi> a priviledge, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed priviledge depends not on the Right of his Princely <hi>Permiſſion.</hi> The Dr. I ſuppoſe, will be loath to extend this Rule to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of Goſſipings among the Good Wives of our Pariſhes, or of Gentlemen to their Innocent Sports, Hoſpitalities and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, the Concourſe of People to Fairs, and Markets, or places of Commerce, or to Coffee Houſes to hear what News comes or flies Abroad, concerning the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World, while in theſe there are no <hi>Apprehenſions of Danger.</hi> But if it be ſaid,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58609:46"/>that the <hi>Apprehenſions of Danger</hi> are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed <hi>Cauſe</hi> of ſuch reſtraining Laws;<note place="margin">Neceſſary Meetings liable to no Reſtriction upon falſe Fears.</note> I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That if, in truth, the Powers have ſuch Apprehenſions of Meetings barely Innocent, they have juſt Right, upon ſuch fears, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, becauſe apprehended not as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but at leaſt dangerous; and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Knowing, or preſuming this to be the Reaſon of the prohibition, ought in Duty to obey it.<note place="margin">

For a <hi>neceſſary Duty</hi> cannot give place to falſe and <hi>unneceſſary Fears.</hi> But now, in all Meetings not prohibited, nor prohibitable by the Prince, if the Prince muſt have always actual Knowledge of ſuch Meetings to diſcharge them from Guile not only Majeſty would hereby be rendred Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, but the Wearers of is be oppreſſed with inrodes of People for giving in ſuch Informations and Petitions for Leave. But if the Dr. had ſet it thus; That ſuch Meetings as the Prince ſhall by Law require Notice of to be given to himſelf, or his Vicegerents in that behalf, in any, or every place, in order to leave hereupon to be given or denyed,<note place="margin">Leave not neceſſary to be asked without a Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch Petition.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Right, or Pleaſure, he had ſpoken much more correctly. For in ſuch Caſe 'tis fit application ſhould be made, not to obtain a Right, but to ſecure the Peace and Honour of the <hi>Prince,</hi> who, tho' he has no right to deny the Meeting, yet has to be ſecured from all dangers thereof. Now the Chriſtians, having no ſuch command as this from the Heathen Powers, to ask leave for their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58609:46"/>but inſtead thereof, being abſolutely prohibited, were under no Obligation of Law or Conſcience to give Knowledge of their Meetings (which would not have been a means to procure leave, but perſecution) nor yet to obey the irreligious Law of Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had Heathen Princes ſet them ſuch a Rule of Leave and Licenſe, there is no doubt but the Chriſtians would have gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and as conſtantly have obſerved it, and have given all manner of ſecurity for their Innocency. From whence it follows, That the <hi>Roman Laws,</hi> as deſigned and pointed againſt Chriſtians, Aſſembling on <hi>Neceſſary Cauſes,</hi> and a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> were Nullities as to the Precept, and Tyrannies as to the Sanctious, and that Severity, which the Dr. adduces as a Weight of Authority,<note place="margin">

               <p n="7">§ 7.<note place="margin">Protection from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Powers.</note> We begin then with thoſe Reaſons that are drawn from the Beneſit of the Church, under the <hi>Guardianſhip</hi> of Princes, the <hi>Protection</hi> of the Faith, and the <hi>Legalizing</hi> our Synods. Now here it is to be noted, That <hi>Heathen Princes</hi> may do all this for the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtian Princes.</hi> For tho' they do not believe Chriſtianity themſelves, either in whole, or in part, yet they may give the <hi>Church</hi> a Legal Toleration to all its Offices, and Aſſemblies, and this <hi>Legalizes</hi> them. He may alſo add other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Charters to his Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſo not only protect but promote them. And this was in great meaſure done by all Non-perſecuting Emperors, and the Perſecutors too, when ceaſing to perſecute by the Revocation of the cruel <hi>Edicis</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> and giving new <hi>Edicts</hi> for their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

To this we require your Synodical Submiſſion, on fear of a Praemunire otherwiſe incurred, that thereupon we may put out an Edict of Praemunire, upon all the Clergy that ſhall attempt any the leaſt Violation of this our Eccleſiaſtical Headſhip or Supremasy.</hi>
                  </q> Yet as odd as this ſounds in all Chriſtian Ears, it is as juſtifiable as in any Chriſtian Prince, if ſuch Protections, as are aforeſaid, are the alone true Reaſon for this Supremacy, for there is no differencing Cauſe aſſigned in the Reaſons. 'Tis true indeed, a Chriſtian Prince looks more likely to protect us, than an Alien, and has one peculiar actually <hi>Federal.</hi> Obligation by his Baptiſm, to ſupport the Communion of the Church, by all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but ſo is every private Chriſtian too; and 'tis poſſible for a Chriſtian Prince to ornit this Care, or to be diſabled in it, while elſewhere, the Humanity of an Heathen Prince may do more for it voluntarily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Federal Tyes of Chriſtianity; and conſequently, if the Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy be Founded on ſuch Protection, and Squared in its Meaſure by the proportion thereof, I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58609:52"/>believe many Heathen Princes had more' tho' unknown, Right in the Eccleſiaſtical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, than many Modern Princes profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſtianity; it being poſſible, that Princes may freely protect Subject Societies, which they are not federally, or otherwiſe bound to (as Jewiſh Synagogues now are in their States of Pilgrimage) which they, that are eſpecially bound to, may oppreſs under the very colour of that Supremacy, that is thus Founded on the Right of Protection; Tho', ſpeaking generally upon the Law of Nature, all rinces are thereby equally bound to protect all the Fundamental Rights of the Innocent, and conſequently thoſe of the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> ſo that the Right and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our protection under Princes, is not Founded in their <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but the <hi>Churches Innocency,</hi> and the <hi>Right</hi> She has to the <hi>Royal Protection</hi> in doing good, by any Acts, or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations Synodical, or other.<note place="margin">Toleration not founded on the Right of all Rehgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oas tolerated but upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exterior Reaſons.</note> Nor will this aſſert a <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Protection</hi> to all pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions; for, tho' the Ignorance of a Prince, in the diſtinction of true Religion from bad, may occaſion him in miſtake, actually to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Right, and cheriſh the Wrong, to avoid which, under that Ignorance, he ought to tolerate that wherein he can ſee no hurt, yet really nothing but real Truth has a real Right to any Protection or Countenance; and the Connivances or Encouragements given to falſe Religions, muſt be excuſed, or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, not on the Right of the Errors (which is none) but on other Reaſons exteriour, either of State, Peace, or other inſuperable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58609:52"/>diſſiculties; nor can ſuch miſtaken, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced Protections, give the Protector an Eccleſiaſtical Headſhip over all thoſe Syſtems of different Religions, to act them all, as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> allows them to Act the Church, becauſe there is no Right bottomed upon Error, (See <hi>Chap</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.) and becauſe many times they are exempt from his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as in the Chappels of Embaſſadors, and Foreign Factories. whoſe Protection is not Founded upon a ſuppoſed poſſibility of Truth, but upon the Reaſons of Commerce and Negotiation.</p>

               <p n="10">§ 10. Having thus enquired into the firſt reaſon for this Alienation of <hi>Synodical</hi> Powers from the Mitre to the Crown,<note place="margin">The forms of alienation improper.</note> let us in the next place examine the Form of it hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which muſt conſiſt in a <hi>Devolution, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation.</hi> or <hi>Contract</hi> with the Spiritual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. If by <hi>Devolution,</hi> this muſt be founded, either in the <hi>Original Ordinance</hi> and <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of God, or from the <hi>Natural Right</hi> of Sovereigns over all Perſons of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The firſt ground hereof I want and can, I doubt, be no where found; and we ſhall have occaſion hereafter to make Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, whether it can or no. And as to the ſecond, I ſhall readily yield it, if it can be made our, that in all Religion, Natural and Revealed, the Prince, that is of it, ſhall have the entire Conduct of it. For then indeed it muſt reſt in the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till they get a King of their Faith, to whom then they muſt turn over all their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58609:54"/>Powers. But why ſhould this Divine Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Devolve</hi> over to Princes, any more than that of a little <hi>Borough?</hi> This of the <hi>Borough</hi> was granted by Kings. Be it ſo; tho' 'tis not neceſſarily ſo; for that popular States may ſo ſix themſelves, and after admit a King to protect them, but without any <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.</hi> But be it ſo. Can then our King be denied a <hi>Devolution</hi> of a Charter in a Town which he <hi>Protects,</hi> becauſe a former King founded it, tho' in a mere Secular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Government, and muſt a Charter founded by the King of Kings <hi>Devolve</hi> to a Temporal Prince out of thoſe Hands, and that Society in which it was veſted, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quite different from the Secular Polity? I do deſire a proof hereof, as weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as the Matter and Conſequences hereof are. What then, is it liable to a Deſpotick <hi>Occupation?</hi> This again is what a <hi>Borough</hi> will not yield upon a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> but will be ready to make a Counter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> from their Prince. In vain would he plead for it on the Right of <hi>Protection,</hi> while he ſtrikes at all their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Rights and Liberties.<note place="margin">Be ſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church here.</note> But we we only are the Poor, Tame, Diſpirited, Drowſie Body, that are in Love with our own Fetters, and this is the only ſcandalous part of our <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> to be not only ſilent, but content with an <hi>Oc—n</hi> of our <hi>P—rs,</hi> which are not forfeited nor forfeitable to any Worldly Powers whatſoever. And as to any Contract, 'tis neither pretenſible, nor pretended by the Doctor; tho' too much in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58609:55"/>truth in latter Ages has been exchanged by the Church for Worldly Intereſts, wherein mainly lies the great Ruine of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. But now we deſcend to the ſecond Cauſe, in which this unlimited Supremacy of Princes is by the Doctor founded; namely, <hi>Civil Intereſts,</hi> as of Peace, and the Princes Prerogative. To both which I for my own part am willing to ſurrender all, if it be neceſſary. But before this however, I would fain know, how do the Laws of Peace require a Violation of thoſe Rights, which God hath lodged in the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> as a means to reconcile all in one Body, unto a common Peace with God, and each other? If the Clergy uſe their Powers to that End, who has Right to hinder them? Who to break the Peace with them? But if they do not, there are other juſt ways of ſecuring them from <hi>doing wrong,</hi> than by diſabling them from <hi>doing Good,</hi> that very Good, which God hath ſet them apart, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them to do. And theſe ways are in the Power and Sovereignty of an Heathen Prince,<note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> as is above manifeſted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſufficient to the ſame ends in the Authority of a Chriſtian Prince, from whoſe Coercion in matters of Crime, the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, how much ſoever to be revered by Princes, ought not to be made a Shelter or Protection. Under theſe Powers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes the Chriſtian Synods made no Rupture on the Peace or Prerogative of the Empire,<note place="margin">Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in all States.</note> tho' as undeſervedly accuſed for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58609:55"/>this by the Heathens, as we are ſuſpected of it now; Why ſhould the ſame Spiritual Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties within a Chriſtian Kingdom, be thought more dangerous than they were to Heathens? I will not ſpeak out how the Churches of Chriſtendom have been cruſhed between the Upper and the Nether Milſtones; but ſure I am, hence are all the Confuſions, both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Papacy and the Reformation;<note place="margin">Be ſure here by all means to except <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> Nor is it poſſible to make any true and ſignal Converſions to the better, as long as there is a common Slavery upon the <hi>Hierarchical</hi> Powers; for as we hate the Bondage of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo they hate the Bondage of the Church under Secular Domination, and ſo hereby is maintained a perpetual and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable averſion, which no illuſtrious Piety can extinguiſh, while the Powers thereof are Chained down to mere Politick Ends and Services.</p>
               <p n="12">§ 12. So that as there is no <hi>neceſſity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the Slavery of the Church.</note> ſo neither is there any <hi>expediency</hi> to recommend any ſuch unlimited Domination. For as Things and Perſons Conſecrated to God are to be treated with a Reſpect and Reverence ſuitable to that Sanctity and Relation to God, ſo a Proſtitution of them under Secular Contempt is no ſmall Impiety towards God, and no ſmall Guilt, Blemiſh, and Indecency in thern that cauſe it. Now of all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun, nothing is ſo hated, feared, and deſpiſed as Servitude; and no Servitude more reproachful than that of Prieſts, which were from the beginning a moſt Noble, Free, and Honourable Order in all Nations
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58609:56"/>not excepting the very Barbarous: Nor yet of all ſorts of Slavery is there any ſo Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous, and Grieving as that, which oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Sanctity, Authority, and Operation of their very Functions; for maintenance of which, the Biſhops of the Primitive Church were chiefly ſought out unto Martyrdom. And yet as hateful as ſuch Vaſſallage is in it ſelf, 'tis leſs Odious under an Heathen than a Chriſtian Prince. For from an open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my 'tis natural enough, and no new thing to expect Oppreſſions, but when a Prince hath been Conſecrated by God's Prieſts into the Communion of the Catholick Church, he is thereby federally engaged to aſſert all the Rights and Authorities of that <hi>Divine Communion</hi> veſted by our Lord in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> as much as every common Chriſtian, or Prieſt himſelf; our Salvation in common being promoted by the Conduct of them, Can then a claim of an Oppreſſive Supremacy, be deemed a Glorious Jewel in a Chriſtian Crown, which if exerciſed, muſt of neceſſity forfeit the Kings Salvation? And is it not a dangerous <hi>Complaiſance</hi> it Prieſts, to fan ſuch an Ambition, as muſt end in the Ruine of the Church, the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the Soul of the Prince, which the Liberties, and Powers Hierarchical were deſigned to Convert, Direct, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve?

And as ſuch a Communion, founded on ſuch a Liberty, would prevent moſt National Wars, ſo would it alſo moſt Inteſtine Seditions.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58609:59"/>Right appertaining to them, and who is there that ſhall ſay to any ſuch Prince, What doeſt thou? So that preſcription, though it will actually carry it in ſuch a Kings Courts, where the Judges are at his own choice and pleaſure, yet is not a ſafe nor certain <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton</hi> of real Right, before free and equal Judgments, as would appear in other Courts, or by the Reſolution of Foreign Lawyers, where their Judgments are not ſubjected. And therefore that <hi>Preſcription</hi> for Kings, which will and muſt paſs with Lawyers, in <hi>foro</hi> for Prerogative, muſt not preſently be taken for infallible Right by all Men, and particularly by Divines, till the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Matter and the Reaſons of the Royal Intereſt appear equal. For the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication hereof, I need not go back ſo far as the Licentiouſneſs of the <hi>Ceſars,</hi> nor ſo far off as to the <hi>Mahometans</hi> Kingdoms; let us but look over the Southern Lake, and ſee how <hi>Prerogative</hi> preſcribes over the miſerable Subjects there, and every where elſe, where the Sword is Arbitrary; and think the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation will appear very well bottomed. So that when the Dr. would argue for all his Exorbitant Powers of Princes over Synods, from their cuſtomary Claims and Practices, to the convincing of Mens Minds of the Rectitude of them, he ought all along, or by a general Set of Reaſon, once for all; to have ſet forth the <hi>unexceptionable Equity,</hi> as well as <hi>Custom</hi> of ſuch Practices; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>cuſtomary Practices</hi> of a Boundleſs Power, will not <hi>ipſo facto</hi> prove their own

               <p n="4">§ 4. To ſhew the reaſonableneſs of theſe Cautions and Exceptions, let us but conſider, how great and large a Preſcription <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> has in thoſe Infidel Countries, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in great part of Chriſtendom, and <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> once had, from almoſt the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> till <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> Days, over the General World, under the ſupport of the Princes Prerogatives; and yet we ſee all thoſe were, and are meer <hi>Nullities,</hi> becauſe there is no equal bottom for them, but the certain iniquity vacates all that <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> which yet did, and ſtill does paſs in Law thro' all the abuſed Countries; ſo that <hi>preſcription</hi> is rather a Rule of Right among Subjects, than in Sovereigns.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. <note place="margin">The Dr. heeded not to any good Originals for his preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Now the Dr. is ſo far from pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Expreſs <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Conſtitution</hi> for the general Right of all Princes in thoſe Powers, which he has ſo liberally aſſigned them, that he does not ſo much as ſuggeſt, nor ſeem to conſider the <hi>preſuppoſition</hi> of any ſuch as the <hi>Original</hi> of theſe <hi>Preſcriptions.</hi> Only in Fact, ſuch things have been done, pretended and claimed by Chriſtian Princes, and never by others without their Conceſſion, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes therefore, it was, and is their Right as <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates,</hi> without any reference to, or <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> expreſſed of any <hi>Legal Original,</hi> no not ſo much as indefinitely and generally; whereas it was to have been expected, that he ſhould have definitely Specified ſome <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Act,</hi> as the <hi>ſuppoſable Original</hi> or <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

We are not now to examine in this Part the <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Facts</hi> of Chriſtian Emperours, in managing the Synods, ſave only by the by, 'tis Obſervable, that the Dr. has cited <hi>Socrates</hi> againſt himſelf.

But to return to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Matter of the preſent Enquiry; it ſeems to the Dr. that the Emperours herein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and copied after the Platforms of the <hi>Jewiſh Princes,</hi> herein manifeſt to every one that Reads their Hiſtory in Scripture,<note place="margin">Synagogue Forms not extant in Scripture.</note> as if the Scriptures had given us a Draught and Model of the <hi>Synodical Polity,</hi> and Forms under <hi>Jewiſh Kings.</hi> This had been a fine thing indeed, an happy Scheme for Church-Government; but <hi>there is none ſo great a Stranger to the Scriptures, as not to know,</hi> that they mention nothing hereof, nor of any Pretenſions their Princes made to it. Here are no Frames of the Great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> no Tables of their <hi>City-Councils,</hi> no Platforms of their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> nor their <hi>Synodical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:58609:61"/>under their Princes exhibited to us. So that 'twas ſo far impoſſible in Fact, that the Chriſtian Emperors herein exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Jewiſh Patterns,</hi> that there were no Jewiſh Patterns in Gods Word, to be followed at all, much leſs with exactneſs; nor is it probable, that the <hi>Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> did ſo much as think of theſe <hi>Jewiſh Kings</hi> in their Synodical Councils, or had the Forms been certain, that they could have had ſuch a value for the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as to think its Conſtitutions Fundamental to the Church, or ſuch an Imperial Authority over it; much leſs when the Scriptures give the <hi>Polity</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> none the leaſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much leſs Recommendation and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to <hi>preſcribe Law</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> for ever, but by its Abſolute and Total <hi>Silence</hi> herein, ſeem to intend, that <hi>that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> ſhould, inſtead of ſuch <hi>preſcriptive Power,</hi> together with the <hi>Law,</hi> be nailed to our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Croſs,</hi> and be afterward decently buried in an Eternal Oblivion. And hence, tho' Men of <hi>Rabbinic</hi> Learning, are very fond to derive our Forms from their Patterns, yet we find no ſuch Conceptions hereof, among the Antients, as no ſhades of it in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> nor Authority for it any where.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58609:62"/>then I muſt tell the Dr. he had never had any opportunity, or inducement to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Book for this ſort of <hi>Supremacy.</hi> But if bare <hi>pretences</hi> alone, create no <hi>Right,</hi> and the Chriſtian Emperours exactly followed them herein, then Chriſtian Princes have hereupon, only <hi>pretence</hi> for this their <hi>Authority.</hi> So that the Drs.

               <p>IT is a great abſurdity to found the Title of our Kings on the pretended Right and Practice of the Emperors, ſince under the Emperors Synods acted ſimply as Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Councils, and (tho' the Dr. is pleaſed moſt falſly to ſay the contrary) aſſerted the Canonical validity of their Acts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince would or no, tho' thoſe Councils, which the Emperors calld, gave them account of their Procedures, and for Peace (not Rights) ſake, deſired their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Concurrence, and Aſſiſtance.

                  <p>This is in effect a Revocation of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer avowed Aſſertion, that no leſſer Synods were ever convened without the allowance of the Emperours. For tho' he ſays, it will be hard to find any contrary Inſtance; yet

                  <p>This in all Acts Synodical he avowedly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Prince yet unhappily falls ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into contrary inſtances and conceſſions unawares, as for example; chap. 2. § 24. p. 55.
